## Instructions

- Copy the contents of this repo folder to your USB drive
- Add your personalized launcher.elf and rename it to `vpx-batman66flash.elf`
- Download the table and directb2s versions listed above, extract (if necessary) and copy them into `vpx-batman66flash`
- Rom file (flash_l1.zip) stays in zip folder, place zip file in `vpx-batman66flash/pinmame/roms`
- Make sure `(.vpx)` `(.directb2s)` and `(.ini)` are all named the same.


## TO GET ALL MUSIC AND SOUNDS TO PLAY

Note that this table, as downloaded, has several sounds (theme music and "BAM! POW!" when hitting targets) that will not play on the 4KP. To hear everything, you will need to patch the table. There are two ways to accomplish this on a Windows PC (not on the 4KP):

Option 1. Download and run VPUPatcher from [VPUniverse](https://vpuniverse.com/files/file/2581-vpuremix-system-vppatching-system-vpx-only/). Follow the VPUniverse instructions to apply the `vpx-batman66flash.dif` to the `.vpx` file. I chose the simple output name of "patched," and got the full filename you see below.

These should be your results:
| File | Size (Windows Explorer)| Size (https://md5file.com/calculator) | Hash (https://md5file.com/calculator) |
|-----------|--------|----------|----------|
| `Batman 66 (Original 2018).vpx` | 146,616 kb | 150134784 bytes | MD5: 7f18278326ee54c1528ad9bb07172b40 |
| `patched.vpx_VPUMod.vpx` | 146,704 kb | 150224896 bytes | MD5: 2c91d62446d13e5b60c449680d1fc3e4|

OR,

Option 2. Open the table in VPinballX on your computer. Open the sound Editor (F2 in the Windows version), and change the output location of the first 11 sounds in the list from "Table" to "Backglass." Save the table, and THEN move it to your USB drive
