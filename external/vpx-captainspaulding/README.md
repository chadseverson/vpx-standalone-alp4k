**Tested by:** [Bla1ze]

**Additional Notes:** The table runs fine however, if you leave it running but are not playing it (Attract Mode), there is the potential it will lock up your 4KP requiring a reboot. This does **not** affect the gameplay and only happens if left alone for 5 minutes or longer.
